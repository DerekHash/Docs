# How many API tokens are there in circulation?

The APIS Protocol launched its mainnet on January 2022 with 50 million API tokens created at genesis. We are ready to launch our Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP), and so would like to re-post the APIâ€™s current distribution, as transparent token distributions are crucial for long-term incentive alignment and value creation in Web3.

Our token economy: We conducted a token split, adjusting the total supply of API from 100mn to 1bn. There will be 1 billion API Tokens released, unless the community votes to inflate the supply via additional incentivization programs or deflate the supply via token burn programs. 79% of the token supply is allocated toward the community, with 50.34% to the users of the network via a usage mining program, and 17% to API Foundation (established for strategic partnerships, namely prominent Web 2.0 or Web 3.0 applications). The remaining 21% is allocated for the founding and future team.
