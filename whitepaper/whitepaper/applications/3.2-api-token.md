# 3.2 API Token

As referenced prior, the API token is designed to be superfluid, utilized for on-chain governance, off-chain governance (namely future product development), and five staking derivatives to ensure incentive alignment among all participants in the API protocol (namely the protocol’s service providers—**API Governors, API Nodes and Gateways, API Rollup Validators, and API Dispute Resolvers—and its customers**).

**On-Chain Governance Rights**



API holders hold meta-governance rights over the entirety of the API protocol. This is provided via the Governance Module, which governs all other API Smart Contracts, including the Governance Module itself (designed modularly), the Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet that signs transactions on behalf the API Treasury, the API ERC20 Contract, and API Staking Contracts.

Those that own or earn API tokens maintain a voice over the entire APIS protocol and are incentivized to continue to govern through additional API through the ve-API program, wherein a portion of future API is given to those who stake and utilize API to govern the protocol.

**Treasury Governance Rights**



After the initial API distribution is complete, all Treasury Governance Rights will be held by API token holders. The APIS Treasury will accrue numerous assets, such as intellectual property, trademarked brands, partner DAO tokens, tangible assets (such as servers and databases), stores of value (such as Ether and stablecoins, accumulated through the selling of APIS products), and the API token itself.



While there will be a specific Working Group to manage the Treasury, whose job will be to write Proposals for the allocation of the Treasury, all Treasury decisions must be approved by $API holders. Additionally, $API holders can vote to remove members from the Treasury Working Group.

**Product Governance Rights**

****

API’s Future Product Iterations and Launches. Ideas can be brought forth both the APIS Core Team and the greater APIS Community, which consists of both $API token holders and non-token holders. While non-token holders can participate in the Discord and Governance Forum (operated on Discourse if desired), they cannot vote on Snapshot with holding the $API token. Below is the sequence of events for Product Proposals, from start to finish. Proposers and voters may receive additional $API as rewards from the API Community Treasury.&#x20;
