Feed what's hot on Tweet\
We are always looking for ways to make it easier for people to receive the latest NFT information, to build and participate in an efficient community that allows users to earn income on the platform, and preferably everyone to hang out on the channel.

Usually people receive fragmented information, and we are also aware of this problem. So we are rolling out a feature that allows users to see the latest and hottest hashtag related tweets in this feature to keep up with the latest information about the NFT market.

This tool does grant a unique and easy-to-use method of building an email list and sharing the latest and most popular content with our community. To use this function, you only need to enter the email address where you’d like to receive these newsletters.

After completing the email address setup, users can input relevant hashtags on the subscription page, or click on the hashtags recommended by the system to subscribe related tweets, which will be packaged and sent to the user's mailbox.

Simply by entering the term or topic you're interested in into the search box on the Explore interface, you can easily get the relevant tweets. It also saves you time by reducing aimless information gathering.

You can follow your favorite hashtag on the Subscribe interface. You can type the hashtag you want to follow into the search box to get relevant tweets. If you're not sure what you want to see, we've also provided some of the most popular hashtags you can subscribe to below the search box
